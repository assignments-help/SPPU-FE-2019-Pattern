# Problem Statement:
# To accept studentâ€™s five courses marks and compute his/her result. Student is passing if
# he/she scores marks equal to and above 40 in each course. If student scores aggregate
# greater than 75%, then the grade is distinction. If aggregate is 60>= and <75 then the
# grade if first division. If aggregate is 50>= and <60, then the grade is second division. If
# aggregate is 40>= and <50, then the grade is third division.
